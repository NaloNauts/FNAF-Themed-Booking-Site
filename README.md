This is a simple Website which hooks up to Mongo Atlas to allow you to Create and Edit bookings for a fictional FNAF themed workshop.

For this to work you will need to create a .env file with a DATABASE variable containing your own mongo connection string, I wont be including my own for obvious purposes
You'll also need to install any missing dependencies
